However, I haven’t talked much about why it’s important. Think of your emergency fund like a big air mattress, there to catch you if you fall from the adventure of your life. It stops you from going back to zero when things go wrong &amp; helps you recover from unexpected situations faster. </p>\n<p><em>Even when you are in debt &amp; that seems like the more urgent goal, it’s important to build this up first, so you don’t have unexpected expenses that drive you into debt again. </em>​<br>​</p>\n<p>Pro-tip: A lot of people slip up by not topping up their emergency fund when they use it. When you need to spend from your emergency fund, you’ve got to replace it, so you don’t run the risk of going to zero if other emergencies come up. Similarly, when your essential expenses increase, top up your emergency fund, so it can cover your true expenses. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Step 2: Debt Repayment -</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">  ALL bad debt should be eliminated ASAP. </span></p>\n<p>Not all debt is bad, however, it holds you back. Why? I see debt like a hole in a bucket (your financial plan) that you are pouring water (money) into. </p>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"table-layout:fixed\" class=\"email-image\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><figure style=\"display:block;margin:12px 0;max-width:100%;width:400px\"><div style=\"display:block;max-width:400px\"><img src=\"https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/34HsEEMBowNzxPxHMYyzGN/ncsadPZRi6LU9T3dxdLCrr/email\" width=\"400\" style=\"width:400px;max-width:100%;border-radius:4px\"></div>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center;display:none\">​</figcaption></figure></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:10px\">Incase you want to know what happens to Scrut - </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LueFhQk5hg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:10px\">watch from 0:58 onwards</span></a><span style=\"font-size:10px\">​</span></p>\n<p>Bad debt, aka debt for items you’ve already consumed, is like a huge hole where water is gushing out. If you have this, your bucket will never fill up. </p>\n<p>Good debt is a smaller hole, however, it only makes sense to have this if you are able to fill your bucket faster than it leaks from the hole. </p>\n<p>Keep in mind that many tiny holes can be just as dangerous as a few big holes. </p>\n<p>Pro-tip:<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CHuosTYAJD2/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u> Choose a debt repayment methodology</u></a> and stick to it. Your biggest risk is wasting time by changing strategies or agonizing over picking the ‘right strategy’. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Step 3: Retirement/Financial Freedom Plan</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">  - Retirement or financial freedom is when the income (interest, dividends, rent) from your investment portfolio can pay for all your bills. </span></p>\n<p>Every single day, you wake up &amp; go to work, so that at the end of the month, you can be paid for your time &amp; you can pay your bills. Having a financial freedom plan means that one day, you have the option to stop relying on a salary or active income to pay your bills.</p>\n<p>Once this happens, you no longer have to be employed. You become <strong>work-optional or financially free</strong>. Many of us want this but don’t have a plan to reach it. We assume it will happen automatically or see it as some pipe dream to be handled later. I'm here to tell you, it helps to be intentional with this goal. </p>\n<p>The easiest way to reach this goal faster is to invest consistently and for the long-term. A solid financial plan will have a portion of monthly savings being invested towards financial freedom. The key here is to <strong>invest it and forget about it</strong>, with the intention to start withdrawing &amp; living off the interest in 15 - 25 years. </p>\n<p>Pro-tip. Using the interest from these long-term investments to fund short term goals like vacations will slow down your journey to financial freedom. </p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Step 4: Sinking Funds</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> - Sinking funds are expenses (not investments) that you know about in advance &amp; typically require a lump sum amount. </span></p>\n<p>Think of vacations, insurance, house deposits, car upgrades, school fees. I’ve <a href=\"https://africaspocket.com/our-blog/sinking-fund-vs-emergency-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">talked about sinking funds </a>extensively in the past. </p>\n<p>A successful financial plan will contribute to sinking funds as a monthly budget item to accumulate a lump sum for a large expense,  separate from your investments towards financial freedom &amp; other long-term goals.  </p>\n<p>This will prevent shocks to your budget when it’s time to pay for the items &amp; will keep you out of debt.</p>\n<p>This approach also helps you reach your long-term goals faster because you don’t keep dipping into your investments to pay for large expenses - meaning you can enjoy compound interest &amp; it's beautiful effects. </p>\n<p><strong>When prioritizing your sinking funds, contribute more to your long &amp; medium-term purchases than your short term purchases. </strong></p>\n<p>Scenario: You have two goals and need to split KES. 25K between them</p>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"table-layout:fixed\" class=\"email-image\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><figure style=\"display:block;margin:12px 0;max-width:100%;width:500px\"><div style=\"display:block;max-width:500px\"><img src=\"https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/34HsEEMBowNzxPxHMYyzGN/qcopf7tYK5yM3ofxmvKxfm/email\" width=\"500\" style=\"width:500px;max-width:100%;border-radius:4px\"></div>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align:center;display:none\">​</figcaption></figure></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>It’s tempting to put the whole KES. 25K towards the short term goal because it feels more urgent. However, because you’ll only be earning interest for a short time, you will end up using more of your savings for short term goals. In this case, only KES. 2,500 (4%) of KES. 62,500 is interest. </p>\n<p>However, for the long term goal, you earn over KES. 300,000 (20% of goal) in interest - an amount that would have taken an additional year to save. </p>\n<p>Pro-tip: Keep your sinking funds in a separate account from your day-to-day spending money (rent, groceries) and from your long-term investments (financial freedom, goals that are 5+ yrs away). </p>\n<p>Which goals are you currently working towards?

<p>A challenge many of us face is competing financial priorities. What do you do first? Build an emergency fund or save for retirement? Save up for a house deposit or for my upcoming vacation? Start with the smallest or the biggest goal? </p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Step 2: Debt Repayment -</strong></span><span style="font-size:18px"> ALL bad debt should be eliminated ASAP. </span></p>
<p>Not all debt is bad, however, it holds you back. Why? I see debt like a hole in a bucket (your financial plan) that you are pouring water (money) into. </p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="table-layout:fixed" class="email-image"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><figure style="display:block;margin:12px 0;max-width:100%;width:400px"><div style="display:block;max-width:400px"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/34HsEEMBowNzxPxHMYyzGN/ncsadPZRi6LU9T3dxdLCrr/email" width="400" style="width:400px;max-width:100%;border-radius:4px"></div>

<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:10px">Incase you want to know what happens to Scrut - </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LueFhQk5hg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-size:10px">watch from 0:58 onwards</span></a><span style="font-size:10px">​</span></p>
<p>Bad debt, aka debt for items you’ve already consumed, is like a huge hole where water is gushing out. If you have this, your bucket will never fill up. </p>
<p>Good debt is a smaller hole, however, it only makes sense to have this if you are able to fill your bucket faster than it leaks from the hole. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that many tiny holes can be just as dangerous as a few big holes. </p>
<p>Pro-tip:<a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CHuosTYAJD2/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Choose a debt repayment methodology</u></a> and stick to it. Your biggest risk is wasting time by changing strategies or agonizing over picking the ‘right strategy’. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Step 3: Retirement/Financial Freedom Plan</strong></span><span style="font-size:18px"> - Retirement or financial freedom is when the income (interest, dividends, rent) from your investment portfolio can pay for all your bills. </span></p>
<p>Every single day, you wake up &amp; go to work, so that at the end of the month, you can be paid for your time &amp; you can pay your bills. Having a financial freedom plan means that one day, you have the option to stop relying on a salary or active income to pay your bills.</p>
<p>Once this happens, you no longer have to be employed. You become <strong>work-optional or financially free</strong>. Many of us want this but don’t have a plan to reach it. We assume it will happen automatically or see it as some pipe dream to be handled later. I'm here to tell you, it helps to be intentional with this goal. </p>
<p>The easiest way to reach this goal faster is to invest consistently and for the long-term. A solid financial plan will have a portion of monthly savings being invested towards financial freedom. The key here is to <strong>invest it and forget about it</strong>, with the intention to start withdrawing &amp; living off the interest in 15 - 25 years. </p>
<p>Pro-tip. Using the interest from these long-term investments to fund short term goals like vacations will slow down your journey to financial freedom. </p>
<p>​</p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Step 4: Sinking Funds</strong></span><span style="font-size:18px"> - Sinking funds are expenses (not investments) that you know about in advance &amp; typically require a lump sum amount. </span></p>
<p>Think of vacations, insurance, house deposits, car upgrades, school fees. I’ve <a href="https://africaspocket.com/our-blog/sinking-fund-vs-emergency-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about sinking funds </a>extensively in the past. </p>
<p>A successful financial plan will contribute to sinking funds as a monthly budget item to accumulate a lump sum for a large expense, separate from your investments towards financial freedom &amp; other long-term goals. </p>
<p>This will prevent shocks to your budget when it’s time to pay for the items &amp; will keep you out of debt.</p>
<p>This approach also helps you reach your long-term goals faster because you don’t keep dipping into your investments to pay for large expenses - meaning you can enjoy compound interest &amp; it's beautiful effects. </p>
<p><strong>When prioritizing your sinking funds, contribute more to your long &amp; medium-term purchases than your short term purchases. </strong></p>
<p>Scenario: You have two goals and need to split KES. 25K between them</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="table-layout:fixed" class="email-image"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><figure style="display:block;margin:12px 0;max-width:100%;width:500px"><div style="display:block;max-width:500px"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/34HsEEMBowNzxPxHMYyzGN/qcopf7tYK5yM3ofxmvKxfm/email" width="500" style="width:500px;max-width:100%;border-radius:4px"></div>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;display:none">​</figcaption></figure></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>It’s tempting to put the whole KES. 25K towards the short term goal because it feels more urgent. However, because you’ll only be earning interest for a short time, you will end up using more of your savings for short term goals. In this case, only KES. 2,500 (4%) of KES. 62,500 is interest. </p>
<p>However, for the long term goal, you earn over KES. 300,000 (20% of goal) in interest - an amount that would have taken an additional year to save. </p>
<p>Pro-tip: Keep your sinking funds in a separate account from your day-to-day spending money (rent, groceries) and from your long-term investments (financial freedom, goals that are 5+ yrs away). </p>
